Dan Mueller, known around church as Pastor Dan, is the son of Lutheran missionaries to Brazil who taught him that being of service to the Kingdom of God is a precious privilege. Mueller has pastored both large and small churches and finds wonderful opportunities in each. He smiles every time he has to ask people at Christ Our Savior to stop visiting with each other so worship can start; he smiles because he knows that what he’s seeing is the mark of a loving and close congregation. Christ our Savior is Pastor Dan’s most recent assignment. He’s excited about working with the good folks at Christ our Savior to discover and to respond to the opportunities we have to be the hands, feet, and heart of Jesus in San Antonio’s inner city.

They were privileged years ago to start a school together and Sharon added a childcare center a few months after the school opened.
